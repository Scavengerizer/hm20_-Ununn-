      <h1>Q: I have watery nose and other symptoms of common cold. But I am also worried if I have corona. What should I do? I am 21 years old. </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        First of all dont worry. Take proper hygienic precautions like regularly washing your hands and wear a face mask to minimize contact with others. Even though corona will be like a common cold to you with no harmful effects, I would still suggest you to go to a hospital and get yourself checked. Because it might not be lethal for you but it can be lethal for others. Otherwise there is nothing to worry about. CHEERS!!

      <h1>Q: I have headache and dizziness from last 5 days whats the reason behind it why it's happening with me </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Chest pain can be due to various reasons . KIndly dont jump to heart attacks but definitely rule it out. so basically chest contains many different structures from where the pathology must be ruled out.

Starting from outermost structures going inwards;

skin and subcutaneous tissues : check for any skin rash ,abscess, or neuralgia.

muscular pain due to undue stretching

bony pain due to inflammation in attachments of ribs to the sternum known as costochondritis

esophageal due to gastroesophageal reflux disease which is common after having meals.

heart causes as in MI where pain is continuous in character ,lasting longer than 20 minutes, or in pericarditis characterized by chest pain, fever, pericardial rub.

lung causes as in pleuritic pain in pleural effusion.another important cause is pulmonary embolism in which case there will be history of prolonged immobilization of the patient.

vascular causes as in aortic dissection which is a medical emergency occuring due to very high blood pressure.

P.S-there are other many causes for chest pain, above being more commonly seen.

      <h1>Q: What should i do about extremely watery eyes? </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        Watery eyes’ suggests two possible problems:excess tear production and/or poor drainage.

Excess production is usually in response to irritation. Irritation is aa total of all the irritants getting into the eyes; a problem rather like dealing with debt! Some irritants will be obvious, especially if they are recent, but many will be due to long term habits, and difficult to identify, because they are due to ‘normal behaviour’. The topic is potentially vast: it includes smoke (from cooking, smoking, fire places, and air pollution), aerosols (from ‘air fresheners’, cleaners, paints), wind, especially cycling without eye protection, dust (especially from hobbies like carpentry), solvents, make-up and make-up removers, and shampoo or just water from the shower.

Poor drainage is due to blockage of the tear ducts, which drain the tears from the inner corner of each eye lid. These can be unblocked by syringing, performed by an ophthalmologist.

      <h1>Q: I have acute pain near my rectum I am also suffereing from constipation. What should I do? </h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        You might be suffereing from piles. But no worries. Please take a high-fibre diet as that can be effective, along with stool softeners. In some cases, a medical procedure to remove the haemorrhoid may be needed to provide relief.
        But most cases can be treated with self care. Along with the high fiber diet, you can also use :
        Ice packs
        Reduces inflammation and dulls sensation of pain.
        Cold compress
        Reduces inflammation and dulls sensation of pain.
        Witch hazel extract
        A liquid made from the witch hazel plant that soothes itching, pain and swelling of the skin
